================

Create koa and express framework API to learn a few bits and bobs

## Setup

You should have npm installed.

If you haven't installed the wonderful npm 'n' module then I recommend you do.

```shell
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n latest
```

At the time of writing this 'latest' will get you 0.11.13 of nodejs.

## To run the koa application

Remember to use the harmony flag.

```shell
node --harmony koa.js
```
